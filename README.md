Roman Numerals

Roman Numerals Kata @ Makers Academy

The purpose of the kata is to design a simple converter from arabic to roman numerals. This was one of the first katas we had to do as part of the course at makers Academy.

The goal was to wirte the solution in a fully TDD way using Rspec.

To run the code clone the repo, switch to the right directory and in irb:
```
require './lib/roman'
```

To convert a number use:
```
roman_number(number)
```

Romans only designed their number system to 4,000 so don't expect the converter to work with larger numbers. Same deal with anything below 1, non-integers etc.
